# Float Trip App
I wrote the Annual Current River Float trip app as a webpage first, then converted it to an Android app. This app highlights specific places on the map where we float each year and includes short stories around these fun spots. It also uses the phones internal GPS functionality and adds a small canoe image on the map at your current location on the river.

The pages were written in HTML, Javascript, and CSS and then later wrapped using NodeJS, Cordova, and Iconic to create the .apk for Android.
